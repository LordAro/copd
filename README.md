# URY COPD

COPD ("C++ Owner for PlayD") is intended to become the main playout system used
by radio presenters at [University Radio York][] (URY).

All code developed for `COPD` is licenced under the [MIT licence][]
(see LICENSE.txt).

## Usage

Pfft. Who knows.

## Features

Bwhaha.

## Compilation

### Requirements

* [Qt][] (5.0)
* A C++11 compiler (recent versions of [clang][], [gcc][] and [Visual Studio][]
  work)

### Building

Once Qt5 is installed, it should be trivial to build.

Running `qmake` should suffice. This will build the program and place it in the
same directory.
